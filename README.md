# Fragment - Interactive Character Chat

A React-based interactive character chat application where you can create characters, position them on a grid, and have conversations with them. Characters respond based on their personality traits and conversation history.

## Features

- **Character Creation**: Add characters with custom names, traits, and avatars
- **Grid-based Movement**: Move your character around using arrow keys
- **Proximity-based Chat**: Chat with characters when you're close to them
- **Autonomous Character Chat**: Characters automatically chat with each other when in proximity
- **AI-powered Responses**: Characters respond using Gemini AI or fallback personality-based responses
- **Persistent Storage**: All characters, positions, and conversations are automatically saved to browser storage
- **Cross-tab Sync**: Changes sync across multiple browser tabs/windows

## Autonomous Chat System

When non-You characters are within 80 pixels of each other, they automatically start chatting about topics generated by Gemini AI based on their personalities. The autonomous chat system features:

- **Topic Generation**: AI generates conversation topics based on character personalities
- **Message Limits**: Autonomous conversations stop after 10 messages when You is not involved
- **Restart Capability**: You can restart autonomous chats by clicking the "Restart Chat" button
- **Automatic Resume**: When characters move apart and come back into proximity, they automatically resume their conversation and continue for another 10 messages
- **Participation Control**: Input field is hidden when You is not part of the conversation
- **Seamless Integration**: Move closer to join ongoing autonomous conversations

### Autonomous Chat Rules

1. **Proximity Detection**: Characters within 80 pixels automatically start chatting
2. **Topic Generation**: Gemini AI generates relevant topics based on character traits
3. **Message Alternation**: Characters take turns sending messages
4. **Natural Timing**: Messages are sent with random intervals (3-8 seconds)
5. **Message Limit**: Conversations stop after 10 messages when You is not involved
6. **You Participation**: When You moves close, you can join and continue the conversation
7. **Restart Option**: Click "Restart Chat" to begin a new conversation with a new topic
8. **Automatic Resume**: When characters move away from each other and then come back into proximity, they automatically resume their conversation and continue for another 10 messages, preserving the conversation history and topic

## Data Persistence

The application automatically saves all data to your browser's localStorage:

- **Characters**: Names, traits, avatars, and positions
- **Conversations**: Complete chat history with each character
- **Conversation Contexts**: AI conversation memory for more coherent responses
- **Autonomous Conversations**: Autonomous chat history and topics
- **Message Counts**: Track of autonomous message counts for each character pair

Data persists until you:

- Clear your browser data/cache
- Use the "Clear Data" button in the top-right corner
- Manually clear localStorage

Storage usage is displayed in the top-left status overlay.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
